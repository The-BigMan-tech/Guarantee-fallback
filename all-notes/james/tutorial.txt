*First,start live share in vscode from the host and send the collab link to the guest through whatsapp or gmail
^the guest should join the host in vscode and communicate through the session chat and share terminals
*The host should install the ngrok vite plugin in the frontend and use it in the vite config file and provide the auth token directly in the ngrok function but it must not be pushed as its a secret.
*The host should do npm run dev in the frontend folder and should see the local host link and the ngrok link.The host should use the local host link while the guest should use the ngrok link provided by the host
^the commands to start the frontend and the backend should be done in the host machine as the folders arent actually in the file system of the guest.
*The host should start his backend in a separate terminal.
*The host should go to another separate terminal,install the localtunnel npm package with npm and run npx localtunnel --port xxxx where xxxx is the port where the backend is running on the host machine.The localtunnel will provide the tunnelling link and the host should provide this link to the guest but the host frontend should not use this link but rather it should use the local host link of the backend.
*The guest should take the backend and frontend links,
*The guest should create and go to a folder which should contain two files:a frontend.js file that will serve as a  proxy to the exposed frontend server from the host and a backend.js file that will also serve as a proxy for the exposed backend.
*The two files can be generated by an ai like perplexity by requesting for sample proxies to be prepared using express,morgan and the http proxy middleware or better yet,copy the sample in my reference that corrected something that the ai wrote
*The guest shoud paste the exposed frontend and backend links from the host and paste them into the api service url variables of the files respectively.
*The guest should run both the backend and frontend proxy files and access them in the browser.
*The guest can now edit the code in liveshare and access the app in the browser
^The proxy links are for the guest while the host uses his own local links.
^the ports that the guest uses in his frontend and backend proxies should be the same ports that the host uses in his own local frontend and backend.The reason for the proxies was to solve a connection problem between the exposed frontend and the backend which was because of the cors setting in the backend and is dificult to get the exact url of the frontend to allow it to bypass cors as ngrok always generates a new tunnel url and changing the the frontend setting to make calls to the exposed backend server address will always reset the server and as such causing ngrok to restart and generate a new one not to mention a lot of other trial and errors.But if it is done through proxies,the url is always predictable as it is always provided through local hosts and it solves the cors error and it must match that of the host to prevent any host configuration overhead in the src code as the src code will decide which local host the backend and frontend server should run on.
