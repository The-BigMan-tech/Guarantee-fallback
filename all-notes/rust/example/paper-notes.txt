static websites--all possible pages are downloaded in your system--no updates.They are also known,fixed and created in production time.

mpas--dynamically gen html on the server that ships to the client

bundlers--can also ship multiple lighteweight units of js code to the app when needed for faster loading times

treeshaking=purging csss.It removes unused styles while the former removes unused code,comments and whitespaces

static,spa,mpa,ssg

ssrs improve seo

spa=hydrated by js on the client side

mpa--its is created on the server using a templating engine like pu and data from requests and serves it to the client.Content is already stored in the server as individual pages not one page.

ssrs = spas + mpa
ssrs can maintain state across page transitions and react spa apps can also do that with redux

in ssr--routing each component with its data is a page,full page reloads
spa--component that refreshes witj data hydrated from js and not go to a new page.Thats why routing to a page made by react router from the browser leads to 404.every component modifies the same html file so it isnt true routing when using react router.


mpas--html is dynamic but spas--html is dynamic but known at runtime

frontend can preserve state but it isnt persitent unless you use a global stae management solution like redux and then save it to locally using local storage or pouch db or on the server.

diff between using a codebase and communicating with a codebase:You use a codebase by importing it as a dependency in yours meaning your codebase is dependent while for communicatimg with a codebase,they are independent of themselves meaning that they are separated but they use an api whether local or remote to commmunicate with each other

separate codebases communicating with a local api runs the two codebases in the same process or thread except that they dont import themselves but communicate over an abstraction called a local api

partial hydration,ssg

ssr--prerendered on the server and hydrated by js when shipped to the client
spa--rendered on the client at runtime

static,mpa,spa,ssr,ssg,partial hydration/islands
hydration--slower page loads

in react you can pass component as props and to access that component,we use props.children

react uses a virtual dom and not the actual dom
svelte compiles your code to js that manipulates the actual dom

You can extract complex conditional rendering into a separate component

prettify typescript better
preserve 3d

its better to use uuid over index as keys for list rendered elemenets in react because the array will become unstable if the array frequently changes.
