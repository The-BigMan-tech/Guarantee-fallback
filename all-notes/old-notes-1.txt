Hero section

Content should come first before layout

SECTIONS
_________
A good web layout should be split into sections or rows that are vertically stacked on each other and each row should only convey one idea and must be visually distinct not necessarily meaning different color styles and give them enough vertical padding and this is because it makes the content more consumablea and prevents a text wall.If you are using a text wall,then you will have only one section and dump the content wall below it just make sure that you split the content into consumable formats using headings or so.
Every row should have a heading so that the content can become easily consumable and not put pressure under the
viewer of your site to consume that info.
Headings should be descriptive and straight to the point

To make sections viusually distinct,you should use background color,images or adequate spacing
