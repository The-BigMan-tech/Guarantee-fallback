^The intellisense of some langauges especially cfg files only work when connected to their language server via a network
*I can actually use turbo console log to provide a full debugging trace
*O auth
//Its possible that someone will pop up a window with a prompt to put sensitive data as if it were from a trusted source.
*electronic storage and hard disk storage

*validation at the form level,request level and database level

^ill make an llm that uses documentations to give you what you need to read

*There is static,dynamic and gradual typing.Python supports gradual typing with its type annotations although being a dynamically typed language

*functions are normally stateless and the only way you can make them stateful is by using a global state,a mutable object or an array to hold the data,a database,class variables in a class,states in frameworks like react

*vs code,blender,godot

*A game is a scene tree which is a tree of scenes like how react apps are tree of components
*A scene is a collection of nodes like how components in react are a combination of jsx,css and js
*Signals are like state in react cuz they allow nodes to communicate with each other
^The observer pattern

^the canvas and svg element

*After you compile your ts file into a js file,you have to provide the declaration.ts file that will be used to provide types for the compiled js file for ts intellisense while interfaces is for the app level

?Code 1
// return new Promise((resolve)=>{
        //     const runLater = async ()=> '';
        //     runLater().then(()=>{
        //         (!(this.isCompressed))?this.compress():'';//to prevent the error when trying to compress an already compressed array
        //         resolve(this.array)
        //     })
        // }) 

?Code 2   
 //return (async ()=>'')().then(()=>{
//     this.compress_safely()
            

^Both code 1 and code 2 do the exact same thing except that the second one creates a promise in the alternate way by using an async function as async functions returns a promise and then calling compress only after it has been resolved.
