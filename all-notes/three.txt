*the fov is the vertical angle in degrees that states how much of the scene the camera views

*the near and far point of a camera define the range of the camera's visibility to control whats rendered for improving performance

inspecting the code of the built in components

You should keep the camera definition (the actual THREE.PerspectiveCamera instance) as an internal object, and then create a class or wrapper that references this original camera object. This wrapper class will provide methods to directly modify as many modifiable properties of the camera as possible.

The custom logic controlling the camera typically uses a limited set of core camera mutations—such as updating position, rotation, FOV, or near/far planes—but complex behaviors emerge by composing these mutations under broader logic tied to different parts of your app state or input.To create complex behaviors like spinning, following a target, zooming, or orbiting, you write higher-level logic that manipulates these properties over time or in response to user input.
