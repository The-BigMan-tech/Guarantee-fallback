TODO:
*at times,the entity navigation system doesnt even notice im there till i get close at it.It could be that i didnt add the relationship properly under the refresh relationships methd or the nav method itself

*sometimes,the container holding the item clones dont get removed from their parents upon cleanup

*my entity controller at times,doesnt hit me when i get directly close at it.it will just be there until i rotate.its the nav method.i checked the logs.it believed that it didnt reach me yet until i rotated a little.

*with a long attack cooldown like 3 seconds,when entities get to me,they wait for the cooldown.but the problem is that even when i travelled far,it still taught it was at target and attacked me from that distance.not only that,it isnt even making any attempt to cover that distsnace.it still assumes that it is at target

*entities dont give themselves space when attacking.they clog themselves

*entities jitter between sprinting and idle on reaching me

*add lin vel check efore cleaning

Chest--Gui,carrying it physically because my item system doesnt allow reverse flow of item data from the world back into the inventory

update pnpm

nest js & webRTC for multiplayer

*throw animation
*the throw animation doesnt play fully for the entity when it runs
*throwing for the player

throw strength ranger---hold down the use key and release once youve accumulated enough strength.it starts from 0 and caps at the player's strength.

weapon behaviour
----------------
plays use weapon animation
adds buffs to attack damage and knockback
item holder will reset buffs when item in hand is null
hammer--lightening particle effect on hit.Its a weapon behviour but with shift E,it will call the interact hook into the rigid body clone class.this will spawn a throwable at runtime to make the hammer throwable as well


How entities will interact with spawned blocks
---------------------------------------------
They will push a request object to a request queue inside the class that updates the clones.so they will push a request to RigidBodyClones.request .A rquest will have a condition property which has data from the entity to be used to get the clone that satisfies the condition.For example,it can have the entity's position and a proximity threshold and then it will check for a clone that is within that proximity to that position.then there will be a response property under the request is Clone | null.its initially null at first when the entity pushes it to the queue.but when rigid boyd clones has found a clone,it will set the response property to that clone.How it will work is that under the same loop that updates the clones,ill do something like this:

private Requests:Dequeue;
for (const clone of clones) {
    const req = Requests.shift();//we want to consume the requests on iteration
    if (clone satisifies condition) {
        req.response = clone;//we already have a response so the request can stay consumed
    }else {
        Requests.unshift(req)//this clone didnt give us the response.so we add back the req to the queue for another clone to consume.Repeat
    }
    if (clone is the lastClone) {
        Requests.shift()//all the clones have seen this request so whether it any of them gave a response or not,it has been processed completely and must be removed for the next request to get its own turn.
    }
}
