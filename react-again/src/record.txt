a thunk is a function that returns another function instead of a state.Its used for performing side effects

ill use a progressive optimization technique where the core functionality is written in js at first using thunks and the code in the thunks is gradually replaced with rust calls

decoupling the implementation from the application

*local file manager
*cloud file manager

redux thunks for client side processing with side effects
rtk query for communicating with server side processing

redux state
reducers manages the state of the app
thunks orchestrates state and call side effect functions
side effect functions/utilities are separate and decoupled from the thunks

components dispatch thunks

undefined: Typically indicates that a variable has not been initialized. This can lead to ambiguous situations where it’s unclear whether the absence of a value is intentional or accidental.
using null union ensures that a value can never be accidentally undefined

switch on union for safety similar to match enum case in rust

variables with no values leads to ambiguity about whether its intentional or by accident.so using null where possible is better so that you can clear this ambiguity and save productivity time from false bug hunting


async thunks and create async thunks

thunks dont return values.just dispatch actions

react,tauri,pouch db,tailwind,daisy ui,redux,chart js,react-toastify,uuid

hello pangea dnd,react router,framer motion,gsap,three js,
next js,auth js,paystack,prisma,postgres sql,mongoose,mongo db

backend as a service or a nest js server

relative ui sizes only makes layout responsive and not content 

client side apps--tauri with react,vue,svelte,rust for performance critical parts
server side apps--tauri wrapper,next js,nuxt js,sveltekit
client side with server side functionality---client side app with rtk query,Backend as a service/nest js server
server side app with client side functionality----server side app but with (redux,client components,pouch db)

implementation,interface,controller
database,file system,app state


TODO:download some assets
TODO:finish the layout of the ui

Todo:Art styles
3d illustration art
neumorphism art
infographics
svg art
lottie animation

todo:resizable panels

3d illustration ai generator

fixed units---requires manual responsiveness,is faster:%,vh/vw,rem
relative units--constant calculations makes it automatic,slows perfromance:px


safe assignment


*so components gets rerendered across updates and only app state is saved across rerenders.return values from function calls arent saved but rather recalled on rerender and since uniqueid isnt a pure function because of the unpredictability of output,the previous ids get lost on rerenders and thus the need to cache their iutputs using useMemo is required

*i could have made the conditional class logic inline by using the ternary operator but doing so will become catastrophic as the component grows because i will have to check each element that manages their own classes that they apply.moving it to a function that an element calls even if its one element makes it easier to reason about.the jsx shouldnt make any decisions on the app state or which classes to apply.they should just render ui.the only decision it makes is on what ui to render based on a condition it doesnt even check but one returned by a function.

*sub functions are the functions within the component function that handles component state management logic.They often read from or modify component state without directly embedding that logic in the JSX.sub functions only make decisions based on the component state but when it comes to the app state or global state,they only dispatch thunks that handle that logic and they dont decide which thunks to dispatch conditionally because they will be influencing the global state.The subfunction determines which ui to render and the jsx follows.

*jsx are no decision makers .the decision making is by sub functions even what to render is by a subfunction so a jsx rendering something conditionally is as directed by a subfunction.the subfunction will return its decision as either true or false and the jsx obeys.

custom hooks
higher order thunks

app state is global,component state is local

components
-----------
State getter and setter
Sub functions--event listeners,class functions,decision makers
Jsx


operations are better centralized than decentralized,have only one responsibility
components are functions that return jsx.
