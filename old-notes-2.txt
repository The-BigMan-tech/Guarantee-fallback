3. Devdocs io-for accessing docs 
4. Msys2-for installing a c++ compiler

12.Property decorator In python
13.Browser sandbox or quarantine
14.You can containerize windows app and deploy it on the cloud as a web application that can be run on the browser
intellisense
Database breaches
A central file sharer that connects a code file directly to chat gpt or any ai app.whenever you ask your ai to generate code for you,it does that directly to a custom code editor  on the web that has typing animation where the code editor scales in size animatedly as the code is typed so that the code looks neater.You can choose a custom theme as defined by a vs code extension.I will  make a reader that will understand a vs code theme extension and translate it to a theme.Use a browser sandbox to launch this for safety
Do not save all your credentials into one gmail account
Do not reuse or save passwords in ypur browser
Do not use the gmail for paid services for free services becaue the free services has a higher chance of data breach
Password manager
File operation watcher app with python
wireframing

PROJECT IDEAS
______________
1. An IDE loading screen: It will be many programming languages logos coming into the screen using fireship intro effects on the logo to form a cluster of logos and then,a load bar.
2. A program that takes an input consisting of a string of numbers and it finds if there is any matching trig no to it in base four.The purpose of this is to easily store answers through a long generated number like a trig no. 
3. Complex one line matching game and make an ai pathing system that can solve it Make a code wars like software by learning how to write tests 
4. Scroll-is a good name for a cool software, framework or maybe a transpiler 
5. In addition to my code wars project,add a 3d playbot like copilots logo but 3d at the top left corner of the screen that will visually be getting smarter the closer they are in solving the problem they want to solve which is measured by how close they are in getting a positive test result.It also turns coding into a game so you have to buy loops,functions and all that stuff
6. Mouse click, scrolling and keyboard sounds with scrolling and icons animation app
7. A gradient and color harmony 3d model painter
8. Boring old text--> sweet infographics generator
9. A program that is similar to the flux eye glare app for mac but with a modern ui look and a more visual way of relaying the information to the user 
10. An app that will inform you when you are about to perform a file operation on a sensitive file in your system.It also keeps a log record of what folders or files you operated on.
11. An app that adds raindrops to your desktop screen based on the weather.
12. An app lock app with a modern ui that doesn't just prevent anybody from accessing your app without the password but also blocks the app from communicating with your computer at all without you opening the app with the password(This is to keep suspicious apps in check).
13. An app that gamifies tasks
14. Code that wants you to break it with code for fun. 
15. Float-A tool that uses a search algorithm to browse on the internet to find a free alternative software to any software or one which has a better pricing with the same quality.Its basically like that honey extension for chrome but for softwares. 



TIPS
_____
1. When hacking,do passive reconnaissance gathering info then exploit 
2. Learn what you need when you need it 
3. Debugging model: TDEL (Testing,Debugging,Error handling,Logging) 
4. Hacking games is just manipulating memory
5. A genius respects simplicity over complexity 
6. Be healthy while coding 
7. Project based learning,practice and creative problem solving is the best way to learn programming and not just coding
8. Create things you find useful to you and not the next big social media platform or something except if it is my big game.
9. Avoid tutorial hell.Dont look for tutorials to solve all your problems but break down heavy problems into smaller solvable ones. 
10. Share your work with a community even if they will roast you because they will expose you to the learning process
11. Learning,iterating and improving
12. Follow tutorials but DONT use the same example
13. Don't create projects that you will not use 
14. You don't have to create something that is relevant to everyone. 
15. Ability to learn and pick up new things is the valuable part of a good programming skill 
16. Architect your tech stack i.e the tools you will use to develop your projects Have a good growth mindset while coding and not a fixed mindset. 
17. Be very tolerant and persistent in solving errors and bugs in your program Write optimized code not necessarily the perfect code 
18. Don't be afraid to make mistakes 
My Good Coding process
	1. You must know how to solve the problem on your own.
	2. Teach a child how you solved the problem step by step,then code it
	3. If you are stuck expressing a particular thought in code,then try different approaches till you get something.
	4. Use tutorial books as a lookup reference
	5. Use the pass statement with the debugger to keep track of program flow 
	6. Code something you are not sure of or something you want to test into a separate file and then transfer it to your main code 
	7. Refactor 


Little skills to understand your code
	1. The right syntax interpretation 
	2. A working mental model 
	3. Track program control flow
